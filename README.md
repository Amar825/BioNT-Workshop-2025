# BioNT-Applied Machine Learning for Biological Data Workshop Reflection and Notebooks-2025
[Details about the workshop](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/applied-machine-learning-for-biological-data-1459)
This was 5-day-long intensive workshop instructed by top professionals in their fields and organised by BioNT (Bio Network for Training). 


This repository is the collection of my reflections, notes, and code from the BioNT Workshop on **Applied Machine Learning for Biological Data**, held from **2â€“6 June 2025**.

This repository contains well-documented hands-on notebooks, my write-ups on core ML and bioinformatics concepts discussed throughout the sessions, and a deep dive into the applications of machine learning in genomics, clustering, classification, deep learning, and accelerated variant calling using NVIDIA GPUs.
