# BioNT-Workshop-2025

# Initial thoughts (12:15am, 27 May 2025)
The workshop is divided into two modules. `Module 1` is focused on building the foundations of NumPy and Pandas, which makes a lot of sense, since it is used everywhere in data analysis or machine learning. Everything is a matrix. I feel pretty okay with my data wrangling skills, but still, I know many things could be done more efficiently. So definitely looking forward to tomorrow, no, it is today, it is already past midnight. I don't know if I am allowed to share the teaching content and stuff, no wait I think I probably can, since they have the most content already out. Anyways, I am gonna keep posting my takeaways and experiences at the workshop here.

`Module 2` is pretty intense, ngl. 5 days of 7-hour sessions, whoof! I'll have to see what the limit of my focus is. I've had such types of workshops before, it was in my master's, `MOL8008 Bioinformatic Methods for Next Generation Sequencing`, but it was not virtual, it was on-site, also there were free baguettes and apple juice, by the 5th day, I didn't even want to look at the baguette. They hard asf. What I am worried about is keeping my focus for all those hours. Since, I also took a recent course from Stanford Medicine called `Fundamentals of AI/ML in Precision Medicine`, I think I have a decent, high-level understanding of the ML algorithms. I am also pretty stoked about the `accelerated genomics`, with all the GPU hype, it sure sounds promising.
