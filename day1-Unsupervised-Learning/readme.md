## **Day 1 Reflection – [2 June 2025]**

### Theory sessions (Katarzyna Michałowska)
### **1. Key Ideas and Problems Discussed**
The materials used by the instructors are in the repo folder itself. In this section, I am going to list out some important concepts that were introduced and we will take a slight deeper dive in some topics i find challenging and write my own understanding of it.

**Unsupervised Learning 101**
`Learning by observation` that is to learn patterns among the data is the nutshell of unsupervised learning. 

  #### Multivariate similarity:
Let's talk about multivariate similarity. Just like the name sounds, it is a metric that assesses similarity between multivariate data (data with multiple features per sample). That could be patients with 1000s of gene expression data for example.  And all these features are dimensions in space, and our patients become a point in this multidimensional space. Our naive human brain cannot comprehend these large-dimensional spaces, but computers can. Later we will talk about the curse of dimensions and the methods developed to shrink it down so our rational intelligence can intrpret it meaningfully. 


#### Elbow Method

#### Hierarchihcal clustering

#### DBSCAN: Density-Based Clustering

#### Dimensionality reduction
##### PCA
##### t-SNE
##### Auto-encoders
##### U-map

### Hands-on  sessions (Katarzyna Michałowska and Pubudu)
### **2. Algorithm/Method Applied**
Which method was discussed and why was it suitable?

### **3. “Problem-to-Solution” Thought Process**
How was the problem framed and how did the ML method solve it?

### **4. Personal Takeaways**
What did I learn?
