## **Day 1 Reflection â€“ [3 June 2025]**

### Theory sessions (Milan De Cauwer)
### **1. Key Ideas and Problems Discussed**
The materials used by the instructors are in the repo folder itself. In this section, I am going to list out some important concepts that were introduced and we will take a slight deeper dive in some topics i find challenging and write my own understanding of it.
